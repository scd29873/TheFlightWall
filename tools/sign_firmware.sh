# WHY A SIGNATURE. The device fetches over TLS it does not verify, and pinning a
# CA was rejected for firmware: the server is behind Cloudflare, the chain
# belongs to someone else and rotates, and a pin that stops matching is a device
# that can no longer update -- with the fix only deliverable by update. Signing
# moves the trust decision off the transport. A hostile network can serve any
# bytes it likes; without the private key it cannot make them boot.
#
# THE PRIVATE KEY IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY and must never be. It lives in
# 1Password (vault `tinkerex`, document `flightwall-firmware-signing-key`),
# alongside the other secrets this project uses -- the same place
# server/.kamal/secrets pulls from. Losing it means every future update needs a
# cable; leaking it means anyone who can answer the device's HTTP request owns
# the wall permanently.
#
# It is fetched to a mode-600 temp file for the length of one signing run and
# removed on exit, so it need not sit on any disk between releases. A local file
# at $FLIGHTWALL_SIGNING_KEY is still honoured and takes precedence, for working
# offline or from another machine.
#
# The public half lives in firmware/config/FirmwareSigningKey.h and is compiled
# into the device. Changing the key requires flashing over a cable, by design:
# an image signed with a new key cannot be verified by a device that only knows
# the old one.
