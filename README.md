# TheFlightWall

TheFlightWall is an LED wall that shows live information about flights passing your window.

> **This repository** is a fork of [FeatherKing/TheFlightWall_OSS](https://github.com/FeatherKing/TheFlightWall_OSS), set up for an **Adafruit MatrixPortal S3 driving four 64×64 panels in a 4×1 row (256×64)**. Start with **[docs/matrixportal-s3-4x1.md](docs/matrixportal-s3-4x1.md)**: parts, chain order, power, flashing, first-time setup, and what this fork changes. Everything below is upstream's README and still applies.

> **About this fork.** This project was **inspired by the original [TheFlightWall](https://github.com/AxisNimble/TheFlightWall_OSS)** (the commercial build sold at [theflightwall.com](https://theflightwall.com)), but it has since diverged almost entirely. The firmware has been essentially rewritten and now shares **almost none of the original code or components**: it drives a **HUB75 RGB matrix** (the original was a WS2812B panel wall), is configured entirely from a built-in **web page**, and uses a new data pipeline (OpenSky + adsbdb/hexdb by default, with optional AeroAPI, Flightradar24, keyless adsb.lol, or a self-hosted FlightWall server that resolves routes and ETA server-side). Full credit for the original concept and build goes to its creators.

This build is at feature parity with the FlightWall Mini: two tracking modes, live flight metrics, filters, and a day/night brightness schedule — all controlled from the web UI, no app required. See [Configuration & Control](#configuration--control-web-ui).

# Component List

- **Display** — a **HUB75 RGB LED matrix**. The firmware targets the Mini's **128×64** geometry (e.g. two 64×64 panels chained, or a single 128×64), but tile size and chain length are set in the web UI, so other layouts work too. Any HUB75 panel supported by [ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA](https://github.com/mrcodetastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA) should be fine.
- **Controller** — an ESP32 dev board. A plain ESP32 works; an **ESP32-S3 with PSRAM** is recommended for the extra headroom (larger displays, TLS). We originally used an [R32 D1](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ESP-32-Development-Bluetooth-Arduino/dp/B07WFZCBH8).
- **Level shifter** *(recommended)* — a fast push-pull **74HCT245 / 74AHCT245** on the HUB75 logic lines for a stable signal from the ESP32's 3.3 V. (A bidirectional I²C-type BSS138 shifter will **not** work — see [Unstable display?](#unstable-display-flicker--pixels-shifted-by-one).)
- **Power** — a **5 V power supply** sized to your panel. A 128×64 can draw up to ~8 A at full white and far less at normal brightness, so a 5 V 5–10 A supply is comfortable. Tie the panel and ESP32 grounds together.
- **Enclosure** — a frame or stand of your choice (3D-printed brackets, wood trim, or the panel's own frame).
- **(Optional) ambient light sensor** — an analog LDR, or an I²C **BH1750** / **TCS3472**, to auto-dim at night.

### Data services
- **[OpenSky](https://opensky-network.org/)** — live ADS-B positions (free, needs an OAuth client id/secret). *Default.*
- **[adsbdb.com](https://www.adsbdb.com/) + [hexdb.io](https://hexdb.io/)** — free route / airline / aircraft enrichment, no key. *Default.*
- **[FlightAware AeroAPI](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/)** — optional paid enrichment for authoritative routes.
- **Flightradar24** — optional, keyless, **unofficial** position+route source (personal use only).
- **[adsb.lol](https://adsb.lol/)** — optional, keyless, community ADS-B aggregator. No route of its own.
- **Your own receiver** — optional, *added in this fork*: PiAware / dump1090-fa / readsb on your network, read from its `aircraft.json` over plain HTTP. No key, no rate limit. See [docs/matrixportal-s3-4x1.md](docs/matrixportal-s3-4x1.md#your-own-receiver).
- **FlightWall server** — optional, a server you deploy yourself; one call per cycle returns routes, airline names and ETA already resolved, falling back to adsb.lol if unreachable.

See [Data API Keys](#data-api-keys) and [`docs/data-sources.md`](docs/data-sources.md) for how each source is used, costs, and trade-offs.

# Hardware

## Dimensions

Depends on the panel's pixel pitch. A 128×64 build from two 64×64 panels is roughly:
- **P2.5** — ~320 × 160 mm (~12.6 × 6.3 in)
- **P3** — ~384 × 192 mm (~15.1 × 7.6 in)

> **Legacy note:** this project started as a large wall built from 20× 16×16 **WS2812B** panels (~63 in) with 3D-printed brackets and wooden supports. That single-data-line design is **no longer driven by this firmware** — it's HUB75 only now. The old build photo ([`images/led-panel-wiring-and-brackets.jpg`](images/led-panel-wiring-and-brackets.jpg)) and WS2812 wiring diagram ([`images/wiring-diagram.png`](images/wiring-diagram.png)) are kept for reference.

## Display: HUB75 RGB matrix

This firmware drives a **HUB75 RGB LED matrix** (like the 128×64 used by the FlightWall Mini), via the [ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA](https://github.com/mrcodetastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA) library. Default geometry is a 64×64 panel ×2 chained = **128×64**; set your panel width/height and chain length from the web UI.

### HUB75 → ESP32 pin map
The data pins are the only compile-time hardware setting — edit them in [`firmware/config/HardwareConfiguration.h`](firmware/config/HardwareConfiguration.h) to match your wiring.

**Two maps, and they are not interchangeable.** The header picks one at compile time from the target; these tables are what it picks. On an ESP32-S3 the classic map's GPIOs are nonexistent (22–25), SPI flash (26–32) or octal PSRAM (33–37), so wiring a breakout from the wrong table cannot work.

**ESP32-S3** (the recommended board — [`esp32s3`](firmware/platformio.ini) env):

| HUB75 | GPIO | HUB75 | GPIO | HUB75 | GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 4 | R2 | 7 | A | 10 |
| G1 | 5 | G2 | 8 | B | 11 |
| B1 | 6 | B2 | 9 | C | 12 |
| CLK | 17 | LAT | 15 | D | 13 |
| OE | 16 | | | E | 14 |

**ESP32 (original)** — the `esp32dev` env:

| HUB75 | GPIO | HUB75 | GPIO | HUB75 | GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 25 | R2 | 14 | A | 23 |
| G1 | 26 | G2 | 12 | B | 19 |
| B1 | 27 | B2 | 13 | C | 5 |
| CLK | 16 | LAT | 4 | D | 17 |
| OE | 15 | | | E | 32 |

`E` is only needed for 1/32-scan (64-row) panels; set it to `-1` for 32-row panels. Power the panel from the external **5V** supply with grounds tied to the ESP32.

### Unstable display? (flicker / pixels shifted by one)
Driving HUB75 directly at the ESP32's 3.3 V can be marginal. The web UI's **Hardware → Signal tuning** section exposes fixes (applied on restart):
- **Clock phase** — turn it *off* first; this usually fixes an off-by-one pixel shift.
- **Driver chip** — many 128×64 panels use **FM6126A**; selecting it fixes flicker/garbage if the panel doesn't init as a plain shift register.
- **I2S clock** — drop to 8 MHz for the most stable signal.

The robust hardware fix is a **fast push-pull level shifter (74HCT245 / 74AHCT245)** on the 13–14 logic lines. Note: a *bidirectional I2C* level shifter (BSS138 type) will **not** work for HUB75 — it's too slow and has too few channels.

# Data and Software

## Data API Keys

The data for this project consists of two parts:
1. **Flight positions & callsigns** — public [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast) data. Selectable in the web UI:
   - **[OpenSky](https://opensky-network.org)** — *default, free, needs an OAuth client id/secret.*
   - **Flightradar24** — *opt-in, no key.* An **unofficial** scrape of fr24.com's internal `feed.js` — the same JSON the live map uses. When a flight's row includes a route, that one call already has route/airline/aircraft too, so the per-flight enrichment lookup is skipped for it; when it doesn't (mainly non-scheduled/GA traffic), the normal enrichment lookup below still runs. Trade-offs: it **violates Flightradar24's Terms of Service** (personal/educational use only — see business@fr24.com for commercial), the endpoint is undocumented and can break or rate-limit, and it parses the whole area in one shot — so it's intended for the **ESP32-S3 (PSRAM)** and a modest radius. OpenSky remains the default; this is never on unless you select it.
   - **[adsb.lol](https://adsb.lol/)** — *opt-in, no key, no account.* A keyless community ADS-B aggregator (ODbL-licensed) — no ToS problem, unlike Flightradar24. Carries aircraft type and registration inline, plus a precomputed distance/bearing, so it replaces the per-flight aircraft lookup too. **Carries no route** — the enrichment lookup below still runs, same as under OpenSky.
   - **FlightWall server** — *opt-in, needs a server URL.* Not a raw ADS-B feed — a small server *you deploy yourself* that fetches adsb.lol, joins it to airport schedules, and returns routes, resolved airline names, and ETA already computed, all in one HTTP call. Enrichment below does not run under this source; the server already did it. Falls back to adsb.lol (no route, no ETA) for the cycle if it can't be reached, and retries automatically — it never freezes or blanks the wall. See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) to build and deploy one.
2. **Flight enrichment** — airline, route (origin/destination), and aircraft type. Always used under OpenSky and adsb.lol; under Flightradar24 it still runs for any flight whose row didn't already include a route; **skipped entirely under the FlightWall server**, which already resolved all three server-side. Selectable in the web UI:
   - **[adsbdb.com](https://www.adsbdb.com/)** — *default, free, no API key.* Callsign → route + airline, ICAO24 → aircraft type.
   - **[FlightAware AeroAPI](https://flightaware.com/aeroapi)** — paid; optional. Can be the primary source, or just a **backup** that only fires when adsbdb misses a flight (so you pay only for the gaps).
   - **Off** — show callsign only.

Enrichment results are **cached per flight leg** (default 10 min) so loitering planes aren't re-queried every cycle. Out of the box the wall costs **$0** for enrichment — you only need the OpenSky credentials. Enter everything later in the web UI — you do **not** have to hardcode anything.

> **📖 See [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md)** for the full rundown: every position and enrichment source, approximate monthly costs, how to configure each, and the trade-offs of the opt-in Flightradar24 source (including its Terms-of-Service and memory caveats).

### Setting up OpenSky
1. Register for an [OpenSky](https://opensky-network.org/) account
2. Go to your [account page](https://opensky-network.org/my-opensky/account)
3. Create a new API client and note the `client_id` and `client_secret`

### Setting up AeroAPI
1. Go to the [FlightAware AeroAPI](https://flightaware.com/aeroapi) page and create a personal account
2. From the dashboard, open **API Keys**, click **Create API Key** and follow the steps
3. Copy the generated key

## Software Setup

### Build and flash with PlatformIO

The firmware can be built and uploaded to the ESP32 using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

1. **Install PlatformIO**:
   - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Add the [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

2. **(Optional) Bake in your WiFi at flash time** — instead of using the browser setup AP, copy [`firmware/config/Secrets.h.example`](firmware/config/Secrets.h.example) to `firmware/config/Secrets.h` and fill in your WiFi (and optionally API) credentials:
   ```cpp
   #define FW_WIFI_SSID      "YourWiFiName"
   #define FW_WIFI_PASSWORD  "YourWiFiPassword"
   ```
   `Secrets.h` is **gitignored**, so your password is never committed. These values seed the device on first boot; afterwards everything is managed from the web UI. (The data pin in [HardwareConfiguration.h](firmware/config/HardwareConfiguration.h) is the only other compile-time setting.)

3. **Upload the firmware and the web UI** (two artifacts). From the `firmware` folder:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload      # flash the firmware
   pio run --target uploadfs    # flash the web UI (LittleFS image in firmware/data/)
   ```
   In the PlatformIO IDE these are **Upload** and **Upload Filesystem Image** under the project tasks. Run `uploadfs` once (and again whenever `firmware/data/index.html` changes).

## Configuration & Control (Web UI)

There is no app to install — the device hosts its own configuration page.

### First-time setup (WiFi provisioning)
On first boot (no WiFi saved yet) the wall starts a setup access point named **`FlightWall-Setup`**. Connect your phone/laptop to it and a captive-portal config page opens automatically (or browse to `http://192.168.4.1`). Enter your WiFi + API keys, save, and restart. After that the wall joins your network — the display shows its IP on boot, and you can reach the same page at **`http://flightwall.local/`** (mDNS) or `http://<that-ip>/`.

### Set credentials over USB serial (no recompile)
After flashing, you can also configure the device from the serial monitor — handy for setting WiFi without the setup AP or editing files:
```bash
pio device monitor -b 115200
```
Then type commands (`help` lists them all):
```
wifi MyNetwork MyPassword
restart
```
Other commands: `status`, `opensky <id> <secret>`, `aeroapi <key>`, `enrich <adsbdb|aeroapi|off>`, `mode <area|flights>`, `loc <lat> <lon> <radiusKm>`, `light` / `light watch` (live sensor reading for calibration), `get`, `set <json>`, `erase`. Changes are saved to the device immediately. (The position source — OpenSky / Flightradar24 / adsb.lol / FlightWall server, plus the server URL — is normally set from the web UI; there's no *dedicated* shortcut command for it like `opensky`/`aeroapi`/`enrich` above, but `set {"api":{"positionSource":"server","serverUrl":"https://..."}}` reaches the same setting.)

### What you can configure from the web page
- **WiFi** — scan + select your network (changes apply after a restart).
- **API keys & sources** — OpenSky client id/secret and the FlightAware AeroAPI key; dropdowns to pick the **position source** (OpenSky / Flightradar24 / adsb.lol / FlightWall server, with a URL field for the last one) and **enrichment source** (adsbdb / AeroAPI / off).
- **Tracking mode**:
  - **Area** — show everything within a radius of a center point (your home/window). An **Auto-detect** button fills the center from IP geolocation (free, no key, approximate — review before saving), with an optional "auto-detect on every boot" toggle.
  - **Flights** — track a specific list of flights by flight number, callsign, or tail.
  - *(Separately, if you run a FlightWall server: **watched flights**. Open the server in a browser — its home page is a form for "follow BA181 on this date". That flight is resolved to its actual aircraft, followed worldwide, and pinned to the top of the wall while it is in the air, whether or not it ever comes near you. Stored on the server, and editable from either page — the device page carries a **FlightWall server** card that drives the same list, and the hand-typed airline names, with the server page's password; see [`server/README.md`](server/README.md).)*
- **Display** — brightness, text color, max flights to cycle, seconds per flight, fetch interval, which **fields** appear on each card (airline+flight, route, **ETA**, aircraft, altitude, speed, heading, vertical rate), and the **no-flights screen** (clock / aviation fun facts). ETA only ever renders for FlightWall-server flights with a resolved destination — blank otherwise, same as an unfilled route.
- **Filters** — altitude band, hide aircraft on the ground, an airline allow-list ("only these"), and an **airline ignore list** ("everything except these" — the way to hide a business-jet operator such as NetJets, which flies airline-format callsigns like `EJA123` and so passes the general-aviation filter). Both lists take operator codes, ICAO or IATA; a finder on the page turns a name into a code by asking your FlightWall server, and each flight in the live list has an **ignore** button. Under the FlightWall server source both lists are also applied server-side, before the nearest-first cut, so an ignored jet costs no slot. A flight you are watching from the server is shown regardless.
- **Brightness schedule** — separate day/night brightness with configurable night hours, using a **POSIX timezone string** (e.g. `EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`) so daylight-saving transitions are handled automatically.
- **Ambient light sensor** — optionally auto-blank (or dim) the panel when the room goes dark. Supports an analog photoresistor/LDR on an **ADC1** pin (ADC2 can't be used with WiFi on), or an I²C **BH1750** lux sensor or **TCS3472** RGBC sensor. **The usable pins differ per board**, so the device reports its own: `/api/status` publishes the ADC1 range and the I²C pins, and the web UI fills them in for you — read them there rather than from any table. Threshold + hysteresis are tunable, and the UI shows the live reading for calibration.
- **Hardware** — tile size and tile count, so you can match any panel layout (changes apply after a restart).
- **Live status** — current connection, mode, and the flights currently on the wall, each with its **distance** (the list is ordered nearest-first).

Settings are stored on the device (LittleFS) and survive reboots — no re-flashing needed to change anything except the data pin.

**The same controls from outside the house.** If you run a FlightWall server, its page (`https://<your server>/`) carries every control listed above **except WiFi**, plus the watched flights and airline names that live on the server. Changes queue there and the wall collects them on its next fetch, so a remote change lands within one fetch interval. WiFi and the device's own control token are deliberately never settable remotely: a wrong network would put the wall out of reach with no way back but a cable. The one thing the server page has that the device page does not is its own two passwords, which are about access to that page rather than about the wall.

> **On credentials.** WiFi and API secrets are stored on the device and are **not**
> returned by `GET /api/settings` — that endpoint is unauthenticated and reachable by
> any peer on your LAN, so it reports only whether each secret is set. Leave a secret
> field blank when saving to keep the stored value. Reading one back requires the
> serial console, which needs physical possession. Note that a LAN peer can still
> restart the device and change its settings; the config UI has no authentication.

## Airline logos

The wall renders a **Mini-style flight card**: an airline logo tile on the left, then the flight number, route, aircraft, and your chosen metrics on the right. Logos are 32×32 tiles stored on the device at `firmware/data/logos/<ICAO>.rgb565` (keyed by the airline's ICAO code, e.g. `UAL.rgb565`).

- A bundled set of **150+ carriers worldwide** (passenger and cargo) ships in the repo as brand-colored code-badge tiles — the airline's 2-letter code on its brand color, not trademarked logo artwork. Airlines without a tile fall back to the same brand-style badge generated on the fly.
- They're flashed as part of the LittleFS image (`pio run -t uploadfs`).

### Add or replace logos
- **Use real artwork** (one airline) — convert a PNG you have rights to use, then re-flash the filesystem. Both converters share one transform ([`tools/rgb565_tile.py`](tools/rgb565_tile.py)), so a single logo and a batch give identical pixels, and artwork too dark to see on an unlit panel is flattened onto white instead of black:
  ```bash
  pip install pillow
  python3 tools/png_to_rgb565.py my_airline.png firmware/data/logos/SWA.rgb565
  pio run -t uploadfs   # from the firmware/ folder
  ```
- **Batch-convert a whole folder** of `<ICAO>.png` logos at once:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/convert_logo_folder.py ~/airline_logos firmware/data/logos
  ```
- **Regenerate the bundled code-badge tiles** (no dependencies): edit the `AIRLINES` table in [`tools/gen_starter_logos.py`](tools/gen_starter_logos.py) and run `python3 tools/gen_starter_logos.py`. Tiles that already exist are skipped, so your own artwork is safe; pass `--force` to overwrite them.

Tiles are a tiny raw format: `uint16 width, uint16 height`, then `width×height` little-endian RGB565 pixels. They can be any size up to 64×64, and every tool here defaults to 32×32 — the size the bundled badges ship at and the size the 128×64 big-panel layout draws. Pass `--size` to the converters only if you want something else; the renderer auto-fits whatever size you provide, but it only ever upscales.

### Layouts by panel size
The flight card adapts to the panel: **192×64 and wider** (e.g. four 64×64 panels = 256×64) uses a wide card: a 64px logo, then airline + flight number and route + aircraft type in double-size type, over the Mini card's two metric rows; **128×64** uses a "Mini" layout (32px logo + airline/route/aircraft beside it + two full-width metric rows: `Alt:4.1kft Spd:258mph` / `Trk:263deg <flight #>`, with IATA airport codes) — the second row shows the flight number or vertical rate depending on the toggle above, except that a resolved ETA (FlightWall server only) takes that slot instead, e.g. `Trk:263deg ETA:~1h05`; **64×64** stacks the logo on top; wide/short panels (64×32, 128×32, 160×32) put the logo at left with text beside it.
