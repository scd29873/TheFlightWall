/*
Purpose: Apply a signed firmware image fetched from the FlightWall server.

Phase 3 of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-server-delivered-assets-design.md.

THE SIGNATURE IS THE TRUST DECISION, not the transport. This device fetches over
TLS it does not verify, and pinning a CA was rejected for firmware: the server
sits behind Cloudflare, so the certificate chain belongs to someone else and
rotates, and a pin that stops matching leaves a device that can no longer
update -- with the fix only deliverable by update. ECDSA P-256 over the image's
SHA-256 removes the transport from the question entirely. A hostile network can
serve any bytes it likes; without the private key it cannot make them boot.

NOTHING IS MADE BOOTABLE BEFORE IT IS VERIFIED. The image streams into the
INACTIVE OTA slot -- which is exactly what that slot is for, and costs nothing
if the download is rubbish -- but the boot partition is only switched after the
signature checks out. A failed download, a corrupted body or a forged image
leaves the running firmware untouched and still bootable.

AND THE BOOTLOADER GETS THE LAST WORD. CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE is
on, so a newly-flashed image boots PENDING VERIFY and is reverted unless it
declares itself healthy. See markRunningImageValid() for what "healthy" means
here -- deliberately more than "reached setup()".

     * MatrixPortal image installed on a DevKit is a boot loop: different pin
     * map, qio_qspi against the N16R8's octal PSRAM (platformio.ini: "qio_opi
     * on this board leaves the PSRAM uninitialised and it boot-loops"), and a
     * different partition layout. Recovery needs a cable, which is precisely
     * what OTA exists to avoid.
     *
     * Derived from the same macros HardwareConfiguration.h dispatches on, in
     * the same order -- the MatrixPortal test MUST come first, because that
     * board is also an ESP32-S3 and CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32S3 cannot tell them
