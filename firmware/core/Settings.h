/*
Purpose: Runtime, web-editable settings for TheFlightWall.

Replaces the compile-time `config/*.h` constants as the source of truth at run
time. The static `config/*.h` namespaces are still used to SEED the defaults the
first time the device boots, after which everything is read from / written to a
JSON document persisted on LittleFS (`/settings.json`).

Flow:
- `Settings::begin()` mounts LittleFS and loads `/settings.json` (or seeds it
  from compile-time defaults on first boot).
- The web UI reads (`toJson`) and writes (`fromJson` + `save`) this struct.
- main.cpp / fetchers / display read fields directly from the global `g_settings`.
