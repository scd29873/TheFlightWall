/*
Purpose: Orchestrate fetching and enrichment of flight data for display.

Supports two tracking modes (driven by g_settings.mode):
- Area:    OpenSky states/all within radius of a center point; metrics come from
           the ADS-B state vector; enriched with AeroAPI route/aircraft + names.
- Flights: A user-specified list of idents/callsigns/tails looked up directly via
           AeroAPI; metrics come from AeroAPI last_position.

Filters (altitude band, on-ground, airline allow-list) and the maxFlights cap are
applied before the (relatively expensive) name enrichment where possible.

Area mode has a second split, orthogonal to the position-source choice above: the
FlightWall server (PositionSource::FlightWallServer) short-circuits the whole
state-vector/enrichment pipeline with fetchServerMode, which fills FlightInfo
directly from one HTTP call. If the server is unreachable that cycle falls back
to the ordinary state-vector path forced onto adsb.lol -- see fetchServerMode.
A server that stays unreachable is backed off (utils/ServerBackoff.h): repeated
failures escalate the retry interval, capped, so a prolonged outage skips the
HTTP call on most cycles instead of paying its timeout every 30s forever.
