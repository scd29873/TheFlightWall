/*
Purpose: Firmware entry point for ESP32 (FlightWall Mini parity build).

Boot flow:
- Mount LittleFS + load runtime Settings (or seed from compile-time defaults).
- Initialize the LED matrix display.
- Connect to WiFi (STA) using saved credentials; if none/failed, fall back to a
  setup Access Point ("FlightWall-Setup") so the user can configure over the web.
- Start the configuration & control web server (replaces the mobile app).
- Start NTP for the brightness scheduler.

Run loop:
- Service the web server (settings edits, status, WiFi scan, restart).
- Periodically fetch + enrich flights (Area or Flights mode) and render them.
- Apply scheduled brightness based on local time.
- React to settings changes / restart requests from the web UI.
